<h1>Notice of Deletion</h1>
<hr>
<h2>How I feel / Why I did it</h2>
<p>Most of you probably don't give a fuck about how I feel, I'm still going to say it anyways.</p>
<p>I felt expendable. I was just along for the ride. Seriously the fact that you can just replace the person who owns the server if they didn't abandon you is just bullshit to me. I was against the ownership policy for this very reason.</p>
<p>This was a mental health thing. If you think I just did it to be an asshole then fuck you, you were part of the problem.</p>
<p>I'm also tried of the fakeness on this server. Fucking people acting like we're best friends then the moment shit hits the fan "Fuck Mathias" "#DeathToMathias" like are you fucking serious? People say it's not for personal reasons, I fucking think not. Do I seriously keep fucking up? Yes. It's the only thing I'm good at. But the fact that so many people I considered friends that just instantly said fuck you after the bottom fell out is just insane. There are people who stuck with me who weren't fake, those I'm greatful for. I'm sure they will come to hate me because I literally deleted the entire server, and I don't blame them. The amount of bullshit I have seen come out of this server is literally insane. People here are always a ticking time bomb and I felt like I had to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Kaboom has been going on for 10 years. Like many people say: it's dying. It was a great run. Someone is probably going to try to re-create Kaboom and I really don't care if they do.</p>
<p>Bottomline is I was just replaceable. People said oh I don't want you to go Mathias blah blah blah a month later <strong><u><i>FUCK YOU Mathias!!! !! !</i></u></strong></p>
<h2>Was this mostly my fault?</h2>
<p>Yes, yes it was. I failed to run a game server community. Did I have to delete it? I felt like I had to. I would never be at rest. The time and money I put into this server, and I just felt replaceable. And from what just happened, it was right.</p>
<h2>"Who the fuck else could be responsible for your mistakes?"</h2>
<p>No one is responsible for my mistakes. But you guys pushed me away and made me do something I never thought I would ever do. When you feel like a puppet in a puppet show you'll go back on your core values. Am I arrogant? Oh yeah. I couldn't recognize my own mistakes and the severeity of situations. I think I have more mental disorders than ADHD and OCD.</p>
<h2>Finding / Contacting me in the future</h2>
<p>If you can still talk to me even past Kaboom then come talk to me. If you're going to scream at me in my DMs I'll read the first line and just ignore you. If you want to try to scream at me don't even try because I won't listen. To my real friends who are still willing to talk to me even after I deleted Kaboom because I was more than just the owner to them, feel free to contact me. I don't know who you are, probably none of you.</p>
<p>I'm moving on with my life. I'm leaving the Minecraft community as a whole, probably forever. I don't know what lies ahead for me, only time will tell.</p>
<p>Those who were saying delete Kaboom probably were joking, but for those of you who are not, here we go, it's gone. It was a great run, to me, I had lots of fun in voice chats and with players here, it's an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>If I didn't burn the bridge with you then I probably just did now.</p>
<h2 style="color: red;"><strong>You did it to mark, we did it to windows, and now you did it to me.</strong></h2>
<p>How you might ask? You fucking pushed them over their limits, and sit there like you fucking did nothing.</p>
